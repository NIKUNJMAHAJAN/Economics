# Impact of Fiscal and Monetary Policy on India's Economy: An IS-LM Framework Analysis
# Project Overview
This project analyzes how recent expansionary fiscal and monetary policies by the Indian government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are likely to affect the Indian economy in FY25–FY26. The analysis is structured using the IS-LM model, which helps visualize the equilibrium in the goods market (IS curve) and the money market (LM curve).

# Problem Statement
In FY25, the Indian economy faced a slowdown due to:
* Muted consumption demand
* Lower government spending
* Global uncertainties and trade tensions
As a result, the RBI revised GDP growth estimates for FY26 from 6.7% to 6.5%.
In response, policymakers introduced:
* Fiscal measures: income tax relief and higher capital expenditure
* Monetary measures: reduction in policy interest rates and an accommodative stance
* The project uses the IS-LM model to analyze the expected effects of these measures.

# IS-LM Framework: Key Concepts
* The two curves in this study are IS & LM Curves:
   # IS Curve: Goods Market
* Derived from the national income identity:

𝑌=𝐶+𝐼(𝑌,𝑖)+G

* Expansionary fiscal policy (higher G and tax cuts) leads to:
  * Increased disposable income → higher consumption (C)
  * Increased government expenditure (G)
* Result: Rightward shift of the IS curve → higher equilibrium output (Y)

     # LM Curve: Money Market
* Equilibrium:

  𝑀/𝑃=𝐿(𝑌,𝑖)

* Demand for money

   𝐿(𝑌,𝑖)=𝑘𝑌−ℎ𝑖

* Expansionary monetary policy increases money supply (M):
  * Lowers interest rates (i)
  * Boosts investment and consumption

* Result: Rightward shift of the LM curve → lower interest rates and higher output

# Policy Measures Analyzed
* The policy measures analyzed were Expansionary Fiscal Policy and Expansionary Monetary Policy:

   # Expansionary Fiscal Policy
* Tax relief: Exemption for individuals earning up to ₹12 lakh annually → boosts disposable income
* Higher public capital expenditure: Infrastructure projects → direct demand stimulus & job creation

   # Expansionary Monetary Policy
* Rate cuts: Policy rate reduced from 6.5% → 6% over February–April 2025
* Accommodative stance: Encourages borrowing and investment
* Increased money supply: Better credit availability for businesses and households


# Combined Impact
| **Aspect**            | **Effect**                                                                                   |
|----------------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Aggregate Demand (AD) | Boosted by higher government spending plus lower borrowing costs, leading to higher demand   |
| Interest Rates        | Reduced, stimulating business investment and big-ticket consumer spending                    |
| GDP Growth            | Expected to recover the lost 0.2% (raising the forecast from 6.5% back towards 6.7%)         |
| Money Market          | Higher money supply meets higher demand, keeping interest rates lower and supporting growth  |


# Visual Summary
* Rightward shift of IS curve → higher demand
* Rightward shift of LM curve → lower interest rates and higher output
* Both together → strong push to restore GDP growth
  
# Conclusion
By using both fiscal and monetary tools:
* Policymakers aim to overcome consumption slowdown and external risks.

* The IS-LM framework shows:
    * Fiscal policy pushes demand directly.
    * Monetary policy reduces borrowing costs, indirectly supporting demand.

Successful recovery depends on:
* Timely project implementation
* Banks passing on rate cuts
* Stable global economic conditions
